Using the hint i read about the unzip command. I came to know apk files follow zip files format.

Then to find the flag i randomly searched in res directory "flag" and i got ta file
named flag.txt. So using `find` command i found the file location. Then finally read its contents
using `cat` command.

Now by observing i find that contents are in hexadecimal form. Therefore i copied the contents
and just went to online hex to string converter site and founded the flag.
