## Ready Gladiator 0

Firstly download the file in linux and open terminal in that directory and 
input the command `nc saturn.picoctf.net 50843 < imp.red`.
I did'nt get the key.
Now after understanding the corewars(from [about corewars](https://www.corewars.org/docs/dummies.html)) 
i edited the file containing line `move 0, 1` to `move 1, 1`
and saved it and again ran the file i got the key.
